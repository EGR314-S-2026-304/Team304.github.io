## Overview

The EGR 314 project states, "create an exploration device". This is a vague ask that leaves many options for interpretation. Team 304 is committed to creating a device that uses a UART daisy chain network to accomplish this exploration device. Similar to EGR 304, the team is required to create and document everything while building this project. One of the largest changes to EGR 314 is that the PCB manufactured will be surface-mounted components compared to EGR 304's through-hole components.

As for the audience of our device, we want to target the curious, the people who are maybe limited by the constraint of not working for companies that have the resources to explore. Team 304 aims to satisfy the ordinary person who would like to explore from the comfort of their own home and not spend large amounts of money on excessively powerful equipment.
