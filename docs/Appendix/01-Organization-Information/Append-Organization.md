## Communication Channels

### Team Communication Method
As a team, we have decided the primary method of communication is through Discord.

*Table #: Team Members' Preferred Communication Modes*

| **Name** | **First Choice Communication** | **Second Choice Communication** | **Third Choice Communication** |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| Michael |   Discord                             |    Email                            |   in-person                             |
| Hafsa |                                |                                 |                                |
| Roshan |                                |                                 |                                |
| Dylan |                                |                                 |                                |
| Quinn |                                |                                 |                                |

### Communication Procedures

Discord was agreed upon as the primary method of communication outside of class. It is expected that a response from at least one group member will be received throughout the day. The primary procedure if a team member is dissatisfied with the team is to bring the issue within the team first, and if nothing changes, then to direct communication with the course instructor to resolve the issue.

 

### Meeting Schedule and Coordination

>Your team should identify common times for meetings every week. If you are not meeting weekly, your team's chances of success this semester are low
Team 304 will meet accordingly, using Discord chat and virtual group calls as needed. The meeting will be scheduled ahead of time in person and listed on the Discord chat to keep everyone accomadated and up to speed. As a group, we understand the flexibility of schedule needed for this course, so changes are to be regular and the group will understand and accept changes as long as one gets the required ask of the group completed. As for accountability, all members will agree upon their role and task before the beginning of the project and be responsible necessary work.


### Team Coordination & Accountability

* Assignments are submitted ....
* To ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required, the team will ......
* Feedback is to be acted on ....
* Missed contributions/assignments/actions will be ...
* Hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter.
* Recognize that a team member is underperforming.
* Help an underperforming team member improve.
* What are the consequences if an underperforming team member does not improve (e.g., pink slip)?

#### Conflict Recognition & Resolution

> List the steps and means of documenting issuses that lead to involving the instructor in a "Pink Slip" processor. It is best to be **proactive** in resolving these issues early in the semester!
