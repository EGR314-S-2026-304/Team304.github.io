## Overview

The goal of Team 304’s exploration device is to be able to remotely observe, record, interpret, and transmit data on natural phenomena that cannot easily be investigated by humans alone. With this template in mind, Team 304 must also integrate a human-machine interface, wireless communication, sensor and actuator subsystems, and a controller as per the requirements of the project. 

As for the audience of our device, we want to target the curious, anyone interested in engaging in the scientific study of our world through data collection and physical observation. Team 304 aims to satisfy the ordinary person who would like to explore the world and beyond.

The Extended Eye drone can increase your exploration duties as it increases your focus area. You can now go places without having to set foot in the actual area, and it transmits, records, and captures all the moments in your exploration. With upgradable hardware, new explorations can be done more advanced than ever.

## Final Selection
In terms of final selection, Team 304 did a brainstorming process over Discord. As a team, we came up with ~100 concepts, both helpful and non-helpful, then conducted a ranking order by placing them into 5 groups, which we felt were necessary. We then took all the data and, as a team, concluded on the EV-Scope. 

The EV Scope is our exploration device, designed to observe and capture the cosmos and structures with precision and clarity. Our goal is to study objects from afar, bringing otherwise unreachable details into focus through advanced imaging capabilities. Despite the simple and compact design, the EV Scope delivers sufficient power and accuracy to produce high-quality images of distant objects, structures, and environments, making exploration both accessible and effective.
